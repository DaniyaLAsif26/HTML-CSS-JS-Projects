Total degree hour,minute and seconds hand rotate = 360

FOR HOURS HAND :-
hour rotation = 360/12 = 30
1 hour rotation = 30 (m hours = 30m)
minutes rotation = 60/30 = 1/2 (m minutes = m/2)
Total hours hand rotation = (30h + m/2)

FOR MINUTES HAND :-
for minutes = 60/360 = 6
1 minute rotation = 6 (m minutes = 6m)

FOR SECONDS HAND :-
for seconds = 60/360
